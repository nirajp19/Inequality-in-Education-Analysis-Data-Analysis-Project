# Inequality-in-Education-Analysis-Data-Analysis-Project

This project involves an in-depth analysis of global educational inequality trends from 2010 to 2021 using a dataset that encompasses various metrics, including HDI ranks, human development groups, and measures of inequality in education. After thorough data preprocessing to handle missing values, the analysis explores key questions, such as regional differences in educational inequality, the average inequality trends over the years, and the countries with the most significant changes in inequality. The project also identifies the country with the highest HDI Rank in 2021. Through data visualization, including bar plots, line graphs, and histograms, the project effectively communicates insights into the dynamics of educational inequality around the world, shedding light on both improvements and challenges in different regions and nations.
